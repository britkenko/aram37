Abstract

The present invention is an autonomous driving system employing a decentralized network-based approach to autonomous vehicle operation. The system integrates multi-sensor fusion (combining data from infrared, LiDAR, and visual sensors) with real-time vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to enhance situational awareness beyond a single vehicle’s perception. A decentralized AI negotiation module (PaCoM) allows multiple autonomous vehicles to collaboratively negotiate driving decisions in real time, while a networked unified autonomy module (NUA) provides coordinated fail-safe responses to system failures or anomalies. The system further includes an ethical decision module (SOMA) that remains dormant during normal operation and activates only when an imminent collision presents an unavoidable moral dilemma. Integration with 5G networks enables features such as real-time tagging of micro-mobility road users, vehicle-to-vehicle maneuver mimicry, and a collective override mechanism for critical failure states. Overall, the invention improves autonomous vehicle safety, cooperative behavior, and ethical decision-making by leveraging decentralized intelligence and high-speed networking.

Background of the Invention

Field of the Invention: The field of the invention is autonomous vehicle control systems, and more particularly, networked autonomous driving technologies that enable vehicles to communicate, cooperate, and make joint decisions in real time. This includes multi-sensor data fusion for perception, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, decentralized artificial intelligence for coordination among vehicles, fail-safe mechanisms for networked vehicle control, and ethical decision-making frameworks for autonomous vehicles.

Description of Related Art: Autonomous driving technology has advanced rapidly, with modern vehicles employing various sensors (cameras, radar, LiDAR, etc.) and onboard algorithms to perceive the environment and navigate without human input. In existing systems, sensor fusion techniques combine inputs from multiple sensors to improve perception reliability; for example, combining camera and LiDAR data can help detect and classify objects in diverse conditions. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications—collectively known as V2X—are also known in the art for sharing basic information such as location, speed, or hazard warnings. For instance, some vehicles can broadcast emergency brake warnings or coordinate simple platooning formations using dedicated short-range communications or emerging cellular V2X protocols. However, current autonomous vehicles largely make decisions independently and do not fully leverage real-time peer-to-peer negotiation or collective decision-making. Traffic coordination still predominantly relies on predefined rules (traffic signals, rights-of-way) rather than dynamic consensus among vehicles. Additionally, when an autonomous driving system encounters a critical failure (such as sensor malfunction or an algorithmic error), the fail-safe responses are typically limited to that vehicle alone—such as handing control back to the human driver or performing an emergency stop—without direct coordinated assistance from other vehicles in the vicinity.

Another challenge in the field is ethical decision-making in scenarios where an accident is unavoidable. Researchers have explored “trolley problem” scenarios for self-driving cars, but conventional autonomous systems do not include dedicated, onboard ethical reasoning modules actively making moral decisions; instead, they rely on hard-coded rules or avoidances that may not cover complex trade-offs. Moreover, the rapid increase of micro-mobility devices (electric scooters, bicycles, etc.) sharing roadways introduces new complications. These smaller road users can be difficult to detect and track, and current systems do not systematically tag or broadcast their presence to nearby vehicles in real time.

With the rollout of 5G networks, there is an opportunity to significantly enhance V2X communication due to 5G’s low latency and high bandwidth capabilities. This can enable more advanced cooperation such as instantaneous negotiation of maneuvers between vehicles, sharing of sensor data (e.g., one vehicle’s camera feed to another), and collective responses to emergencies. Yet, up to now, no comprehensive autonomous driving solution has integrated all these elements—multi-sensor fusion, real-time V2X, decentralized consensus-based decision-making, network-coordinated fail-safes, ethical dilemma handling, and micro-mobility awareness—into a single unified system. There is a need for a new approach that addresses these gaps, improving safety and efficiency by treating vehicles not just as independent agents but as part of a collaborative, networked intelligent system.

Summary of the Invention

The present invention provides a Decentralized Pan Network Auto Driving “Cerberos” Module, which is a comprehensive autonomous driving system architecture that improves upon existing technologies by introducing decentralized cooperation and enhanced safety features. In one aspect, the invention is an autonomous vehicle control system that integrates multiple specialized subsystems, each addressing a key challenge in autonomous driving:
	•	Multi-Sensor Fusion Subsystem: A perception system that combines inputs from infrared sensors, LiDAR units, visual cameras, and optionally other sensors (such as radar or ultrasonic sensors) to create a robust, real-time model of the vehicle’s surroundings. By fusing data from different spectra and modalities, the subsystem can detect obstacles, other vehicles, pedestrians, and micro-mobility users under various conditions (including low light or inclement weather) with greater accuracy than any single sensor alone.
	•	V2X Communication Interface: A vehicle-to-everything communication module that connects the vehicle to a network of other vehicles, infrastructure, and devices. Utilizing high-speed, low-latency links (such as 5G cellular networks or equivalent), the interface allows continuous exchange of information including vehicle position and velocity, sensor findings, intent signals (like planned turns or lane changes), and alerts. This real-time connectivity extends the vehicle’s awareness beyond line-of-sight and enables cooperative maneuvers.
	•	Decentralized AI Negotiation (PaCoM): A “Pan-network Consensus Module” (PaCoM) that enables multiple autonomous vehicles to negotiate driving decisions collaboratively without a central controller. When vehicles approach interactions that benefit from coordination (for example, merging lanes, unregulated intersections, or platooning together on a highway), each vehicle’s PaCoM shares its intentions and constraints and collectively agrees on an optimal set of actions (such as which vehicle goes first or the formation order of a platoon) via a consensus or voting algorithm. This decentralized negotiation avoids conflicts and optimizes traffic flow and safety by treating vehicles as cooperative agents rather than isolated units.
	•	Networked Unified Autonomy (NUA) Fail-Safe Coordination: A fail-safe management subsystem that engages multiple vehicles and infrastructure in responding to emergencies or system failures. If an autonomous vehicle experiences a critical malfunction—such as a sensor failure, loss of control, or sudden incapacitation of its driving software—the NUA module on that vehicle and in nearby vehicles will detect the anomaly through shared data. The vehicles then execute a coordinated response, which may include broadcasting an emergency stop signal to surrounding traffic, collaboratively slowing down traffic in the area, or even allowing remote or peer vehicles to assume limited control to guide the malfunctioning vehicle to safety. This networked approach ensures that a single vehicle’s failure does not lead to a collision or cascade into a larger accident, as other vehicles collectively adapt to maintain safety.
	•	Ethical Decision Module (SOMA): A special decision-making component called the “Safety-Oriented Moral Arbiter” (SOMA) that remains dormant during normal driving scenarios. The SOMA module is designed to activate only when the autonomous vehicle faces an imminent collision or an unavoidable accident scenario where any available action will result in some level of harm (for example, a situation where a crash cannot be prevented but choices exist regarding mitigating damage to different parties). In such rare cases, the SOMA module evaluates the situation based on pre-programmed ethical guidelines or priorities (such as minimizing overall harm, protecting human life, or following legal/ethical directives) and assists in selecting a course of action. This ensures that if a moral judgment is required, the vehicle’s response is consistent with an ethical framework rather than arbitrary or purely based on simplistic rules.
	•	Additional Cooperative Features: The system supports real-time tagging and tracking of micro-mobility participants (e.g., cyclists, scooter riders, and pedestrians with personal mobility devices) by detecting them via onboard sensors and broadcasting their presence and trajectory to other nearby vehicles through the V2X network. This cooperative tagging improves the visibility of these often less conspicuous road users to all vehicles in the vicinity. The system also enables vehicle-to-vehicle mimicry, wherein one autonomous vehicle can imitate the driving behavior or specific maneuvers of another vehicle under certain conditions. For example, if a lead vehicle successfully navigates a hazard or optimizes a path through complex terrain, a following vehicle can mirror that trajectory or behavior, effectively learning in real time from the lead vehicle. Finally, in critical failure states or extreme emergencies, the architecture implements a collective override mechanism. This means that if a particular vehicle’s autonomous control system is malfunctioning or not responding appropriately to a dangerous situation, the network of nearby vehicles (or a designated control authority in the network) can temporarily override that vehicle’s autonomous decisions. The override could involve commanding the malfunctioning vehicle to slow down, stop, or otherwise yield control in a way that prevents an accident, acting as a safety net beyond the capabilities of any single vehicle.

In summary, the Decentralized Pan Network Auto Driving Cerberos Module offers an integrated solution that merges advanced perception, communication, and decision-making technologies. By doing so, it transforms autonomous vehicles into cooperative entities that share information, negotiate actions, and back each other up in emergencies. This invention not only improves routine driving efficiency (through coordination and mimicry) but also dramatically enhances safety and reliability in edge cases (through network-supported fail-safes and ethical decision handling). The system is designed to be compatible with existing and future vehicular communication infrastructure (especially 5G networks) and can be implemented as an onboard module in new vehicles or as an aftermarket add-on to upgrade the capabilities of existing autonomous driving systems.

Detailed Description of the Invention

System Architecture Overview (FIG. 1)

Referring to FIG. 1, the autonomous driving system of the present invention is implemented within a vehicle (100) equipped with a network of sensors and specialized processing modules. The vehicle (100) includes a sensor suite comprising at least an infrared sensor (101), a LiDAR sensor (102), and a visual light camera (103). These sensors may be mounted around the vehicle to provide 360-degree coverage and are operatively connected to an onboard computing system. Sensor outputs are fed into a multi-sensor fusion module (110) that processes and combines the data in real time. The fused sensor data produces a dynamic environmental model around the vehicle, identifying objects (other vehicles, obstacles, pedestrians, etc.), their locations, and their movements, thereby providing a comprehensive view of the vehicle’s surroundings.

The vehicle (100) further includes a V2X communication module (120), which is a wireless transceiver interface capable of communicating with external entities. In one embodiment, module (120) is a 5G cellular communication device configured for automotive use, enabling both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. This communication interface allows the vehicle to continuously send and receive data to and from nearby vehicles and infrastructure nodes. The data exchanged may include the vehicle’s own status (position, speed, acceleration) and intended maneuvers (for example, an upcoming lane change or turn), as well as incoming alerts or information from other vehicles (such as their positions or warnings of road hazards ahead).

Central to the invention is the vehicle’s onboard processing unit (130), which can be one or more electronic control units (ECUs) or a high-performance AI computer dedicated to autonomous driving. The processing unit (130) hosts several software modules that correspond to the key functionalities of the Cerberos system: a Pan-network Consensus Module (PaCoM) (131) for decentralized negotiation, a Networked Unified Autonomy (NUA) module (132) for fail-safe coordination, and a Safety-Oriented Moral Arbiter (SOMA) module (133) for ethical decision-making. These modules (131, 132, 133) operate in conjunction with the sensor fusion output from module (110) and the communication interface (120). The processing unit (130) also interfaces with the vehicle’s control systems (140) – which include the throttle, brakes, steering, and other actuators – to execute driving commands. In normal operation, the vehicle’s autonomous driving controller (which may be part of or work alongside processing unit 130) uses the fused sensor data and any information from V2X module (120) to make driving decisions (like accelerating, steering, and braking) much as a typical autonomous system would, but augmented by the additional Cerberos functionalities described below.

Multi-Sensor Fusion Subsystem

The multi-sensor fusion module (110) continuously receives raw data streams from the infrared sensor (101), LiDAR (102), camera (103), and possibly other sensors. Each sensor type has unique advantages: the infrared sensor (101) can detect heat signatures, making it valuable for spotting living beings (pedestrians, animals) or distinguishing warm vehicles in low-light conditions; the LiDAR (102) provides precise distance measurements and 3D mapping of the surroundings; and the camera (103) captures visual details useful for object recognition (such as traffic light states, lane markings, or reading road signs). Module (110) employs sensor fusion algorithms to combine these inputs into a unified representation. In one embodiment, module (110) uses a weighted data fusion approach that dynamically adjusts the weighting of each sensor based on environmental conditions. For example, at night or in poor visibility, the system may place greater emphasis on infrared and LiDAR data, whereas in clear daylight, high-resolution visual camera data might be weighted more heavily. Advanced machine learning models (such as a deep neural network trained on multi-sensor data) can also be utilized within module (110) to perform object detection and classification by leveraging the complementary information from all sensors.

The output of the multi-sensor fusion subsystem is a comprehensive environmental model that identifies the location, size, and velocity of nearby objects, along with classifications (e.g., pedestrian, bicycle, car, road debris). This model is updated in real time (multiple times per second) and is provided to other modules of the system, ensuring that any decision-making or communication is grounded in the most accurate understanding of the immediate environment. The accuracy and redundancy afforded by sensor fusion also enhance safety: if one sensor fails or provides erroneous data (for instance, if the camera is blinded by glare or the LiDAR is obstructed), the other sensors can compensate, and the fusion algorithm can flag inconsistencies for further evaluation by the fail-safe system.

V2X Communication and 5G Network Integration

The vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication module (120) is responsible for extending the vehicle’s situational awareness beyond what its own sensors can directly detect, by exchanging information with other vehicles and connected infrastructure. In one embodiment, module (120) uses a 5G cellular network link, which provides low latency (on the order of a few milliseconds) and high bandwidth communication suitable for real-time driving data exchange. This high-performance wireless link allows the vehicle to both broadcast its own status and receive timely updates from others. For example, the vehicle (100) can continuously broadcast a “heartbeat” message containing its exact position, speed, heading, and potentially its intended next actions (such as a planned lane change). At the same time, it listens for similar heartbeat messages from nearby vehicles. Through V2X communication, each vehicle essentially becomes a node in a decentralized network of road users, able to learn about events outside its line-of-sight—such as a car several positions ahead suddenly braking, or a warning from a smart traffic light about an impending change—well before its own sensors might detect those events.

In addition, the communication module (120) is utilized for specific collaborative features of the Cerberos system. For instance, when the decentralized negotiation process (PaCoM 131) is in use, module (120) transmits negotiation-related messages (like proposals for merging or yielding) to other vehicles and relays their responses. Similarly, if the fail-safe NUA module (132) needs to coordinate an emergency maneuver, it uses module (120) to send coordination signals (such as an emergency stop command or a synchronization message to nearby cars to slow down together). The reliance on a 5G or equivalently fast network ensures that these critical messages are delivered and received with minimal delay, which is crucial for maintaining safety during high-speed or complex traffic interactions.

It should be noted that while 5G network integration is a highlighted feature for optimum performance, the system can fall back on other communication channels if needed. For example, if the vehicle is outside 5G coverage, it might use direct V2V radio communication (such as DSRC or another automotive Wi-Fi protocol) to maintain connectivity. The design is flexible to accommodate future communication standards as well. All V2X communications can be secured with encryption and authentication protocols to prevent malicious interference or false messages. Such cybersecurity considerations are important in any networked vehicle environment, though the specifics of security implementations are not the primary focus of this invention.

Decentralized AI Negotiation (PaCoM)

Each vehicle in the system is equipped with the Pan-network Consensus Module (PaCoM) (131), which handles decentralized negotiation with other vehicles. Unlike centralized traffic management systems, PaCoM operates on a peer-to-peer basis: vehicles communicate directly (or through local network hubs) to reach agreements on driving maneuvers. The PaCoM can be implemented as a software algorithm running on the processing unit (130), utilizing inputs from both the sensor fusion module (110) and the V2X module (120).

When a situation arises that involves multiple vehicles interacting, the PaCoM modules engage in a negotiation protocol. Examples of such situations include:
	•	Merging lanes on a highway, where two or more vehicles must decide how to adjust speeds to merge smoothly without collision.
	•	An uncontrolled intersection (e.g., a four-way stop or an intersection with non-functioning traffic lights) where vehicles must decide the order of crossing based on arrival times and safety considerations.
	•	Cooperative platooning, where vehicles arrange themselves into a convoy with minimal gaps to reduce drag and increase road capacity. Here, vehicles must agree on platoon formation, leader selection, following distances, and coordinated acceleration/braking.
	•	Overtaking maneuvers on a single-carriageway road, where an autonomous vehicle might negotiate with an oncoming autonomous vehicle for right-of-way, or coordinate with a vehicle ahead to create a safe opportunity to pass.

The negotiation process typically involves the exchange of each vehicle’s intentions, preferences, and constraints. For instance, a vehicle intending to merge could broadcast a message: “Requesting to merge into lane at position X.” The vehicles already in that lane, via their PaCoM (131), evaluate the request in light of their own state (e.g., distance and speed relative to the merging vehicle) and their own intentions. They might respond with messages such as, “Acknowledged, will slow down by Y mph to create a gap,” or “Negative, currently too close—merge after me.” The PaCoM algorithms on each vehicle then resolve these inputs and reach a consensus. This can be achieved through a variety of distributed decision techniques or rules—for example, a simple algorithm might assign priority based on a combination of factors like arrival order and relative speed, whereas a more sophisticated approach could involve predictive modeling of the outcomes for each possible decision and choosing the one with the least overall delay or risk.

Importantly, the PaCoM negotiation happens quickly and in a deterministic manner to avoid indecision or deadlock. If for some reason consensus cannot be reached (e.g., due to a communication failure or a situation the protocol cannot resolve), the system can fall back on default traffic rules or a conservative safe action (such as all vehicles coming to a controlled stop if at an intersection). However, under normal circumstances, PaCoM allows vehicles to handle many encounters more fluidly than static rules would, potentially reducing stops and delays, avoiding conflicts through clear communication, and optimizing traffic flow and safety by actively coordinating behavior.

Networked Unified Autonomy (NUA) Fail-Safe Coordination

The Networked Unified Autonomy (NUA) module (132) in each vehicle is dedicated to detecting failures (either within its own vehicle or in other vehicles nearby) and orchestrating a coordinated response to maintain safety. This aspect of the invention ensures that autonomy is not just about normal operation, but also about robust behavior in abnormal situations through cooperation.

Within a vehicle, NUA (132) constantly monitors the health and status of critical autonomous driving components. This can include diagnostics from sensors (e.g., an error or blackout in a sensor), the performance of the main control algorithms (e.g., if the vehicle’s path planning or control software becomes unresponsive or is producing erratic outputs), and even driver state in vehicles that have a human occupant (for example, detecting if a required human takeover is not happening despite an alert, which might indicate the human is incapacitated or not paying attention).

When NUA (132) identifies a serious fault or anomaly in its own vehicle that jeopardizes safe operation, it immediately communicates an alert through the V2X module (120) to nearby vehicles and/or infrastructure. This alert can be a specialized message indicating the type of failure (for example, “Vehicle 100 brake system failure” or a general “Vehicle 100 unable to control itself”). At the same time, the NUA engages local fail-safe actions on the vehicle itself, such as gradually reducing speed, activating hazard lights, or switching to a backup control mode.

For vehicles receiving a failure alert about a peer, their NUA modules (132) will take appropriate actions to collectively mitigate any risk. These actions can vary depending on the scenario:
	•	If a vehicle ahead in the same lane signals a failure and is decelerating unpredictably, following vehicles can automatically begin to slow and, if safe, change lanes to avoid a pile-up, effectively coordinating a controlled deceleration pattern that propagates to warn traffic further behind.
	•	If a nearby vehicle loses steering or control and starts drifting out of its lane, other vehicles can create space around it. In some cases, unaffected vehicles might even position themselves to guide or herd the malfunctioning vehicle to a stop (for example, one vehicle could move ahead of it and another behind it, boxing it in gently to slow it down).
	•	In the event that a communication network is available to broader traffic management (e.g., through connected infrastructure), an alert can be sent to traffic control centers or cloud services which might then broadcast area-wide signals (such as setting nearby traffic lights to red to halt cross traffic until the incident is resolved).

One particularly powerful aspect of NUA is the concept of collective override. If a vehicle’s autonomous control is malfunctioning in a way that it does not properly respond to its situation (for example, if it fails to brake for an obstacle due to a software bug or hardware fault), the NUA system allows external intervention. Vehicles around the malfunctioning car (or a traffic management node in the network, if available) can issue a control override command via the network to that car. The affected vehicle’s system is designed to accept such override commands when authorized by the NUA protocol: for instance, a command to cut engine power, apply the brakes, or steer the vehicle to the shoulder might be executed to prevent an accident. This essentially means that the collective of nearby vehicles (or a designated authority in the network) can step in to control a rogue or failing vehicle enough to mitigate danger. All such interventions are constrained by safety and security rules to prevent misuse; for example, override commands may require a consensus among multiple vehicles or a cryptographic authorization from an infrastructure authority before execution, ensuring that one malfunctioning unit cannot maliciously trigger actions in others.

Through NUA, the invention ensures a unified response to problems: rather than each vehicle acting in isolation when something goes wrong, the vehicles act as a coordinated network to uphold safety. This significantly reduces the likelihood that a single vehicle’s issue will result in harm, because the rest of the system does not blindly continue normal operation but rather adapts collectively to the situation. This level of inter-vehicle assistance and control sharing is unprecedented in current autonomous driving practice. It essentially treats all vehicles in the network as a cooperative safety net, ensuring that if one node fails, the others actively help to prevent a disaster (much like multiple aircraft and air traffic control might assist a plane in distress, here done in an automated and decentralized fashion on the road).

Ethical Decision Module (SOMA)

The Safety-Oriented Moral Arbiter (SOMA) module (133) is an intelligent module designed to address scenarios that involve ethical decision-making. Under normal operation of the autonomous driving system, SOMA remains inactive or in a passive monitoring state. The main driving logic of the vehicle (composed of sensor fusion, path planning, obstacle avoidance, etc., along with any PaCoM negotiations and NUA monitoring) is expected to handle routine and emergency situations to the best of its ability following all safety rules. However, there are conceivable scenarios—though rare—where the autonomous vehicle might find itself in a no-win situation requiring a choice between undesirable outcomes. A classic example often cited is an unavoidable accident where the vehicle must choose between two collisions (for instance, veering left might injure a pedestrian, while veering right might hit another vehicle).

In such extreme cases, the SOMA module (133) becomes active. The trigger for SOMA could be when the system predicts that a collision is imminent and that all available purely technical solutions (e.g., maximum braking or standard evasive maneuvers) cannot avoid it completely. At that point, SOMA takes input from the sensor fusion module (110) about the environment and, potentially, also from V2X communications (120) if relevant (for example, knowledge about the number of occupants in other vehicles or additional context, if such data is available and permitted). Using this information, SOMA evaluates possible actions according to an ethical framework configured for the vehicle. This framework could be set by the vehicle manufacturer or regulatory guidelines and might incorporate principles such as:
	•	Minimize harm to human life above all else.
	•	Obey traffic laws unless doing so would directly cause greater harm in the situation.
	•	Prioritize the safety of the vehicle’s occupants or vulnerable road users (e.g., pedestrians) according to predefined policies.
	•	Randomization or impartial selection if multiple outcomes are ethically equivalent, to avoid systematic bias.

SOMA then recommends or directly chooses an action path among the limited options remaining. For example, if faced with either striking a large object or swerving into a smaller object after braking has been applied to the maximum, SOMA might choose to collide with the smaller object, under an assumption that it could result in less impact force and thus less potential injury (assuming neither option can be fully avoided). In another scenario, if an unavoidable collision involves multiple parties, SOMA might determine a steering direction that distributes the impact in a way that minimizes overall harm (for instance, glancing blows instead of a direct hit, or choosing to impact another vehicle in a way that its safety systems can best protect its occupants).

Crucially, the presence of SOMA in this system provides a transparent and consistent method to handle ethical decisions, as opposed to leaving such split-second moral choices as an emergent side-effect of the normal driving algorithm or to random chance. The module’s decision process can be logged for post-event analysis, providing accountability and a basis for understanding why a particular action was taken—this is important for legal and public trust reasons, allowing stakeholders to review and refine the ethical policies as society’s standards evolve.

Because SOMA is only invoked under specific dire conditions, it does not interfere with everyday driving. It essentially acts as a safeguard that steps in when normal safe-driving algorithms have exhausted their ability to prevent an accident completely. In normal conditions, SOMA has no effect; the vehicle will simply avoid accidents per standard programming and physical limits. But in those rare worst-case scenarios, SOMA ensures that the vehicle’s behavior aligns with a deliberate ethical framework, rather than leaving the outcome purely to chance or simplistic rules.

Real-Time Tagging of Micro-Mobility Devices

The system includes functionality to specifically handle micro-mobility devices and other vulnerable road users, leveraging both its perception and communication capabilities. Micro-mobility devices refer to entities such as bicycles, electric scooters, skateboards, e-bikes, and even pedestrians, which are generally smaller and sometimes slower-moving than cars but share the road space. These are often less conspicuous and can be more unpredictable than traditional vehicles.

In the present invention, when the sensor fusion module (110) identifies such an object in or near the vehicle’s path (for example, detecting a cyclist in an adjacent lane or a person on a scooter crossing the street), the system not only tracks it for the host vehicle’s own path planning, but also creates a tag containing key information about that object. This tag data might include the object’s type (e.g., “bicycle” or “scooter”), its current position and velocity (direction and speed), and a timestamp or confidence level.

Via the V2X communication module (120), the vehicle then broadcasts this tag to other vehicles in the vicinity. In one embodiment, this could be done as an anonymized V2X message such as “Detected scooter at location X moving north at 10 km/h.” Other autonomous vehicles receiving this message can incorporate that information into their own environment model. This is particularly useful if the micro-mobility user is in a position that is not immediately visible to all vehicles (for example, hidden behind a larger vehicle or momentarily occluded by buildings or other obstacles). By sharing the tag, the first vehicle effectively extends the sensing range of all others around it.

This real-time tagging significantly improves safety. Even if a particular car has not yet detected the cyclist or scooter with its own sensors, it becomes aware of their presence through the network and can preemptively adjust its driving (such as reducing speed, widening following distance, or being prepared for unexpected movements by that cyclist). Additionally, infrastructure nodes (like smart traffic lights or city traffic management systems) could also receive these tags to integrate into broader traffic monitoring or to issue warnings through other channels. The tagging mechanism is designed to be efficient in terms of data: essentially just an identification, classification, and kinematic data, which can be broadcast periodically or when a new micro-mobility entity is detected.

Vehicle-to-Vehicle Mimicry

Vehicle-to-vehicle mimicry is a cooperative behavior enabled by the system, wherein one vehicle (often a trailing or nearby vehicle) can emulate certain driving actions of another vehicle. The purpose of this feature is to allow vehicles to coordinate movements very closely or to leverage another vehicle’s decisions when appropriate, thereby enhancing safety or efficiency.

For example, consider a scenario of platooning on a highway: a lead vehicle might have direct communication with infrastructure or superior sensing of road conditions ahead, and it adjusts its speed optimally. Following vehicles can use V2X signals to mimic the lead vehicle’s acceleration and braking patterns almost immediately. By doing so, they effectively move in sync as a cohesive unit, maintaining very short gaps safely and improving aerodynamic efficiency. This reduces stop-and-go oscillations (accordion effects) and increases road throughput. Such platooning mimicry is already an anticipated benefit of connected cruise control systems, and the invention provides a robust framework for it within the larger cooperative system.

In a more complex scenario, imagine two autonomous vehicles approaching an unexpected obstruction on the road (e.g., debris or a pothole) where there’s only one safe path around it. The first vehicle, using its sensors, identifies a safe maneuver to avoid the obstacle—perhaps by shifting slightly to the left within its lane. If the second vehicle’s view of the obstacle is initially obscured (say the first vehicle is blocking its line of sight or the obstacle is low to the ground), the second vehicle can enter a mimicry mode. Through V2X communication, the first vehicle can share its planned trajectory around the hazard or simply signal “follow my path.” The second vehicle then mirrors that trajectory, effectively trusting the first vehicle’s guidance to navigate the obstacle safely. By mimicking the exact path, the trailing car avoids the hazard without needing to independently detect it at the last moment, thereby increasing reaction speed and safety.

Another case of mimicry could involve conforming to driving behavior for consistency. For instance, if an autonomous car is following a human-driven car through a series of turns in a neighborhood, the autonomous car might mimic certain nuances of the human driver’s behavior (like the timing of braking or the path taken through a turn) to ensure a smooth flow and not confuse or startle the human driver. The mimicry here serves as a form of learning or adaptation to local driving styles, enhancing acceptance and safety.

From an implementation perspective, vehicle-to-vehicle mimicry is facilitated by the PaCoM module (131) and the V2X module (120) sharing intended trajectories or control signals among vehicles. Importantly, each vehicle still uses its own sensors and will abort the mimicry if it detects an unexpected hazard or if conditions change. Mimicry is only engaged when it is determined to be safe and beneficial—essentially as a strategy chosen by the vehicle’s AI when appropriate. The vehicles also negotiate the mimicry through PaCoM: a lead vehicle might implicitly or explicitly grant permission for others to mimic (to avoid any dangerous copycat behavior if the lead needs to do something the follower shouldn’t). In summary, mimicry is one more tool in the cooperative driving toolkit provided by this system, to be used judiciously to improve coordination and safety.

Collective Override in Critical Failures

As discussed in the NUA section, collective override is a safety feature where multiple vehicles (and possibly infrastructure) collaborate to intervene in the control of a vehicle that is not handling a critical situation properly. This feature essentially allows the network to override an individual vehicle’s autonomous decisions in emergencies to prevent accidents.

To illustrate, suppose an autonomous vehicle (Car A) has a sudden hardware or software failure that causes its throttle to stick open or its main driving computer to freeze. Car A begins to behave erratically or is on course to collide with something because it cannot brake properly. In a conventional setup, Car A would become a runaway vehicle, and unless a human takes over or some automatic emergency stop triggers internally, it might crash. In the Cerberos Module system, nearby vehicles detect Car A’s abnormal behavior via V2X alerts (Car A’s NUA might broadcast its own failure) and through their own sensors. Immediately, those vehicles initiate a collective override: for example, a vehicle directly ahead of Car A (Car B) might transmit an override command to Car A instructing it to cut engine power and apply brakes. Simultaneously, another vehicle behind or alongside (Car C) prepares to maneuver or also send supportive override signals to ensure Car A slows down. Car A’s system, which is designed to heed legitimate override commands, executes a safe braking maneuver on receiving these commands through a low-level failsafe controller, even if its main AI is unresponsive. In this way, Car A is brought under control with the help of its neighbors, ideally before a collision occurs.

In another failure scenario, imagine Car A’s sensors malfunction and falsely detect an obstacle that isn’t there, causing Car A to slam on the brakes in the middle of a fast-moving road. If nearby cars (Car B behind, for example) determine via their own sensors that the obstacle is non-existent (i.e., Car A is “seeing” a phantom object), they can issue an override telling Car A to ignore the phantom and continue moving or move to a safer location. Essentially, the network consensus can override a single vehicle’s flawed perception. Here, the collective effectively “votes” that Car A’s reaction is mistaken and rescinds it, preventing a potential rear-end collision that would have occurred if Car B plowed into Car A’s unexpected stop.

Collective override can also be mediated by infrastructure or cloud-based control systems, if present. For instance, a roadside unit or traffic management center that monitors the network might detect a malfunctioning vehicle and send an authenticated override command that vehicles listen to. The design of the system is such that trust is paramount: only authorized sources (whether other vehicles that jointly agree or a trusted infrastructure node) can effect an override. All override actions are also logged and communicated to ensure transparency.

This level of coordinated intervention means that the safety of autonomous driving is no longer solely dependent on individual vehicles acting correctly; instead, the entire network of vehicles works together to maintain safety. It is a paradigm shift from isolated autonomy to unified autonomy, where even in the face of individual failures, the group maintains control. By having this collective override capability, the system provides a powerful fail-safe that dramatically reduces the chances of a catastrophic outcome from any single-point failure.

Example Use Case Scenario

Several autonomous cars approach a busy urban intersection where the traffic light is temporarily out of service (flashing caution). Among them, Car A, Car B, and Car C are equipped with the Cerberos Module system. A pedestrian pushing an e-scooter (micro-mobility user) is also waiting to cross. As the vehicles reach the intersection, they become aware of each other through V2X communication and recognize the uncontrolled intersection scenario. Using their PaCoM modules, Cars A, B, and C negotiate the order of passage. Car A arrived slightly before the others and is going straight, so it signals its intent to go first. Cars B and C (approaching from different directions) acknowledge this; they agree via the consensus protocol that Car A proceeds first. Car A drives through the intersection safely.

Car B and Car C now need to determine who goes second. Suppose Car B is intending to go straight and Car C intends to make a turn. Their PaCoM negotiation considers factors like arrival time and the fact that Car B’s going straight may clear the intersection faster. They conclude that Car B should go next while Car C waits momentarily. Car C yields accordingly. By this point, Car A has cleared the intersection.

During this process, all cars’ sensor fusion modules have detected the pedestrian with the scooter starting to cross the street. Car B, which is about to enter the intersection, sees the pedestrian stepping into its path. Its sensor fusion identifies the scooter and the person, and immediately the micro-mobility tagging feature broadcasts that information. Car C, still waiting on its side of the intersection, receives the scooter tag via V2X and thus is aware of the pedestrian even though Car B might be blocking its line of sight. Car B’s SOMA is not needed in this case because yielding to a pedestrian is a normal, non-dilemma situation well-handled by standard rules. Car B simply pauses and lets the pedestrian cross before it goes.

Suddenly, another vehicle (Car D), which is not part of the network (imagine it’s an older human-driven car), approaches the intersection at high speed, apparently unaware that the traffic light is out. Car D is on a collision course with Car B, which is still stopped yielding to the pedestrian. Car C’s sensors pick up Car D’s rapid approach, and Car B’s sensors and NUA detect that Car D is not slowing down. Car B’s NUA module immediately broadcasts an imminent collision alert over V2X. Car C, seeing the danger and having a clear path (since it was waiting), decides to act: it moves into the intersection slightly, positioning itself to shield the pedestrian and Car B. Essentially, Car C deliberately places itself in Car D’s path if Car D doesn’t stop, acting as a barrier. At the same time, Car B’s NUA triggers it to stay put (or if possible, to inch forward out of the direct path) and Car A, which has just passed through, receives the alert and begins to slow down further down the road, prepared to assist if needed.

Now, in this extreme case, the SOMA module in Car C may activate because the situation has become one of life-and-death choices. Car C (perhaps an empty autonomous taxi or a vehicle with one occupant) is effectively sacrificing itself to protect Car B (which might have passengers) and the pedestrian. SOMA evaluates this action: the ethical framework might consider saving the pedestrian and the occupants of Car B as a higher priority, even if it means risking Car C’s well-being. Car C’s SOMA concurs with the NUA-driven action to act as a sacrificial buffer, as it represents the least overall harm—assuming Car D does collide, better to hit Car C (which is prepared and can control the impact somewhat) than to hit the pedestrian or plow into Car B’s side where people are definitely present.

After such an incident, all vehicles would log the event data for later analysis. In this hypothetical scenario, Car D does indeed collide with Car C, and because of Car C’s intervention, Car B and the pedestrian avoid harm. Car C’s safety systems (airbags, etc.) protect its occupant (if any) or at least minimize damage, and emergency services are notified automatically via the network (Car A or an infrastructure node could send out an emergency call). Once the situation stabilizes, the network might broadcast a message to other approaching vehicles to reroute or stop until the intersection is cleared.

This scenario, while dramatic, demonstrates how the various components of the system work together in concert: PaCoM allowed the autonomous cars to smoothly negotiate the intersection when the traffic light failed, the micro-mobility tagging ensured that all cars were aware of the pedestrian, NUA coordinated a collective response to the unexpected reckless Car D, and SOMA guided the moral decision for Car C to protect more vulnerable parties at great cost to itself. In everyday driving, scenarios would not usually be this extreme; most of the time the system’s contributions would be seen in smaller ways—vehicles coordinating merges and lane changes, sharing sensor data to see hidden obstacles, and providing gentle fail-safe interventions like early warnings and controlled braking. Nonetheless, the inclusion of these advanced capabilities ensures that the system is robust and prepared even for critical, rare events, significantly elevating the overall safety and trustworthiness of autonomous vehicles.

Implementation and Integration

The Cerberos Module system can be implemented through a combination of software and hardware integrated into an autonomous vehicle platform. The multi-sensor fusion functionality can leverage existing computing hardware found in self-driving cars, such as GPUs or dedicated AI accelerators, to run the fusion algorithms and neural networks. The V2X communication interface (120) uses standard automotive communication hardware (for example, a 5G modem or DSRC unit and its antenna) coupled with software for formatting and parsing the data messages according to required protocols. The PaCoM (131), NUA (132), and SOMA (133) modules are primarily software components (algorithms and decision-making logic) that run on the vehicle’s main processing unit (130) or a specific safety processor. These can be programmed in a way that they continuously run in the background, monitoring inputs and stepping in when their function is needed.

Integration into vehicles can be done at the manufacturing stage or via retrofitting. For new vehicles, an automaker could incorporate the Cerberos Module’s components into its autonomous driving stack, adding the necessary sensors if not already present (e.g., an infrared camera, if not standard) and ensuring the communication systems meet the spec (5G or similar). For existing autonomous vehicles, an aftermarket upgrade kit could include additional hardware (sensors or communication devices) and a computing module that interfaces with the vehicle’s control systems (through the CAN bus or other control interfaces) to implement the invention’s features. The software would need access to the vehicle’s actuator controls to execute decisions (for throttle, brake, steering override commands when necessary) and to the vehicle’s existing sensors for baseline operation.

It is also important to incorporate robust security and authentication measures, especially for features like collective override, to prevent any malicious entity from seizing control. This may involve digital certificates for vehicles, encrypted communication channels, and consensus rules as described to ensure only legitimate override commands are honored. These measures ensure that the benefits of networking do not come at the cost of vulnerability to cyber-attacks.

However, those integration details and security implementations can be managed with known techniques in the field of connected vehicles. The essence of this invention lies in the novel combination of decentralized negotiation, cooperative fail-safe, and ethical decision-making capabilities integrated into an autonomous driving system. It will be understood that various changes and modifications can be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the specific nomenclature of the modules (PaCoM, NUA, SOMA) is for clarity in this description; the functionalities could be implemented under different names or combined in different ways by a designer while still accomplishing the same overall results. Likewise, the invention could be applied to other types of autonomous agents (such as drones or autonomous delivery robots) operating in a network that could benefit from similar cooperative and ethical decision-making principles. The scope of the invention, therefore, should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the specific examples given.
